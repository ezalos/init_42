# https://superuser.com/questions/1482933/ifconfig-shows-multiple-network-interfaces

# lo0 is the loopback virtual interface.
# en0 is your built-in Wi-Fi.
# en1 and en2 are your Thunderbolt ports. macOS supports IP over Thunderbolt this way.
# bridge0 is a virtual interface that bridges your two IP over Thunderbolt interfaces together.
# en3 is likely an external Ethernet dongle in your scenario.
# awdl0 is Apple Wireless Direct Link. It's an Apple-proprietary, incompatible equivalent to Wi-Fi Aware or Wi-Fi Direct. It's how AirDrop and AirPlay and Handoff and a few other things work.
# p2p0 Is like an earlier version of AWDL. When AirDrop first came out and was Mac-only, it used this. iOS never used this and used AWDL instead. Now both platforms prefer AWDL but the older mac-only Apple Peer to Peer wireless protocol still exists for backwards compatibility with older Macs running ancient versions of macOS.
# utun0 is a tunnel virtual interface used for VPN connections.
# ipsec0 is also a VPN-related virtual interface.
# gif0 is a virtual "generic interface" used for certain IPv6-in-IPv4 tunneling situations.
# stf0 is a virtual interface for an obsolete IPv4/IPv6 transition mechanism known as 6to4 that is still in use by a few people.
# The *HC* interfaces are for using a packet sniffer to capture USB traffic instead of network traffic.
# Please note that the exact meanings of en0-enX vary from model to model. The lowest numbers go to built-in Ethernet ports first (in any exist) then to built-in Wi-Fi, then to built-in Thunderbolt ports, if any. After that comes add-on Ethernet-like interfaces (such as USB Ethernet dongles, Thunderbolt Ethernet dongles, and USB Wi-Fi dongles) in the order they were seen by the system.
